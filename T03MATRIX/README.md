# __Task 03 Matrix__


## __Task statement:__

### 1. First level

Implement N x N matrix determinant calculation algorithm. Template solution recommended for matrix class, and std containers usage in matrix class implementation is forbidden.

---

## __Implemented features__

### 1. std::vector analog:

Exceptions safe template container which owns dynamically allocated massive is implemented.

This container provides O(1) element access algo complexity, push amortized O(1) complexity and pop O(1) complexity. Iterators are also implemented.
