In this repository are my projects implemented during my second-year ILAB course.

There is a simple warm-up project T00, and a few more interesting projects:

- T01TRIANGLES - geometrical calculations project
- T02TREE (will add a link to organization repo soon) - Red-black tree with some extra functionality
- T03MATRIX - matrixes & linear objects stuff + my own std::vector analog implementation
- T04ParaCL (not ready for now) - another strange language interpreter
