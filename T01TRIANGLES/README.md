__Task 01 Triangles__

## __Task statement__

### 1. First level - done

Implement two triangles cross algorithm. Implement N triangles cross algorithm with N log(N) complexity in general case.

### 2. Second level - TODO

Implement triangles drawing with Vulkan API.

## __Implemented features__

### 1. Geometrical primitives:

Classes for basic 3D geometric primitives such as: point, vector, line, segment, plane are implemented.

### 2. Two triangles cross:

Triangle class is implemented. Two triangles cross algorithm is implemented.

### 3. N triangles cross:

N triangles group cross algorithm is implemented.

And there is also complexity optimization for big triangles groups - such groups are splitted into smaller geometrically separated groups to achieve N log(N) complexity in general case.
